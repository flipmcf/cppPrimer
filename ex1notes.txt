Notes from exercise 1:
    
I am using Linux.

My C++ compiler is `g++`

and I'm able to compile with:
  `g++ -o <output filename> <source file>`
  
and run with:
   `./<output filename>`
   
(I don't like using 'a.out' as a default filename.)

-----
on the shell, `echo ?$` gives you the return code (see ex1.cpp)

Return codes in BASH are postive, 8-bit numbers, so `return -1` will yeild the 2's complement postive # of 255
