Notes from exercise 1:
    
I am using Linux.

My C++ compiler is `g++`

and I'm able to compile with:
  `g++ -o <output filename> <source file>`
  
and run with:
   `./<output filename>`
   
(I don't like using 'a.out' as a default filename.)

-----
on the shell, `echo ?$` gives you the return code (see ex1.cpp)

Return codes in BASH are postive, 8-bit numbers, so `return -1` will yeild the 2's complement postive # of 255

-------
exercise 1.5 asks: "Why is this code illegial":

  std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
            << "and " << v2;  
            
  it's illegial because you terminate the statement with a ';' on line 1
  Line 2 therefore has no lvalue for the '<<' operator encountered as the first token
   (that's a guess, I didn't actually try to run it.)
   
   pretty easy to fix - just remove the semi's
