exercise 2.1:

What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short?

--int, long and long long have different minimum storage sizes required by the C++ standard.  
16, 32 and 64 respectively, allowing them to store a larger range of values.
short and int both require at least 16 bits, so the difference between them is system and/or compiler dependent.

Between unsigned and signed:
  unsigned types represent only positive values, including zero.
  signed types represent values both negative and positive - generally equally balanced on both sides.
  
Between float and double:
  the number of _significant_digits_  (not scalar value) of double is larger than float.
  Standards say that floats carry a minimum of 6 sig digits, doubles have 10.

To calculate a morgage payment, what types would you use for:
rate: double   (need 5, maybe 6 significant figures:  xx.xxxx)
principal: double
payment: double 

Basically, you need to be able to hold a decimal, and round to the nearest tenth of a penny, 
and display to the penny.
